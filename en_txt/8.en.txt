Come to SatsVsFiat.com - we've set up a website which helps people get up and
running. If you're just getting started, maybe even never heard of Bitcoin before,
come sign up and we'll send you some information so you can learn about
it for yourself and make your own decisions about Bitcoin.
If you're further along and maybe even call yourself a Bitcoin already then amazing.
This is not a commercial enterprise for me, this is a charitable one,
and so any support from within the Bitcoin Community, or from further afield, I would
love to receive. If people want to give this talk themselves to their friends or just share it more
broadly or even volunteer to give a presentation as part of our group, then just get in touch.
And the third one is inviting us to speak - we want as many people as
possible to see this presentation because the information contained within it about
what the problem is is so important. So we'd love to speak, if you'll have us,
at schools, universities, industry conferences, events,
even at workplaces if people are interested to learn more. So please just get in touch.
Here's the QR code which will take you directly to the website. Alternatively, if you are on
X and want to come and say hi and join the conversation with us then please, please do.
Firstly, thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. Please share this with
anyone you care about. And, if there's one thing that you take away from this is
I hope you will remember that: if we fix the money, we'll fix the world thank you [Music]
